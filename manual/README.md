# Documentation and Examples

The documnetation tries to follow the appproach of the [Divio Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com) .
That means it should consist of 4 parts:
1. Tutorials in the tutorial folder and the markdown sheet here. They are little
scripts for the introduction and aim to be Learning orientedand help to get
somethingstarted in LAserCAD.
2. How-To-Guides lying around here. They are problem oritnted and show the
construction of some more advanced assemblies, with more explanation in between.
3. Reference: information oriented and shows the code and its interface.
Honestly, there are some generic tools for this, but I don't want to do this.
You can look in the code, it is modularized, mostly verbose and commented.
You can also find a lot of it in the:
4. Discussion and Explanation, which is understanding oriented and shows the
object structure of LAserCAD together with some thoughts about the why and how.

In short: Just try some tutorials code snippets, and one of the how-to-guides
and horse around.

In very short for members of my RLP group: Just call me. Seriously, it is that
simple. 47825. I'm there :)
