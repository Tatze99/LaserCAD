Procrastination next level!

In short: LaserCAD helps you quickly prototyping and scripting your optical 
setup with as few commands as possible in the language of geometric optics and
a ton of default values. The it approximates the raytracing and shows you a 3D
view of everything in FreeCAD.

The creed is:
1. Make the common case simple.
2. The user should be able to set everything in the script, but the default values should also be set so well that it is not necessary.
3. The code should be designed in such a way that you know where to reprogram something if necessary. (OK, let's see.)

# How to use:
- Install [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php)

- Have any kind of python interpreter and a numpy version.

- Download the repository to an arbitrary location
```
git clone https://github.com/klee-mens/LaserCAD.git
```
Now you can execute e.g. the /tutorial/0_Opening.py in your interpreter. 
You should get some text output like 
```
The geometric object <Composed_Mount:unnamed> is drawn to the position[108.51854, 264.70476,  80.     ] with the direction [-0.95766,  0.2566 , -0.13053]
```
when you open the exact same file in FreeCAD and execute it as a macro by 
pressing on the green arrow or F6 you get an new FreeCAD document with the 3D
model looking like this:

# Some notes and tips

After that you can continue executing the other tturoials and tests. Some may
take a few seconds, but most likely the computation time is less than a minute.
In the manual folder you can find some more or less usefull texts about the 
program and the ideas behind. Some other documents may follow.

In each executable script the first lines import the location of LaserCAD in 
the sys.path list so that python and FreeCAd can find the package. While I am
sure that there excists a better way of installing it, ... I have no clue how
to do it. So for the moment, make sure, that every executable script has these
lines on top and is in the work directory or somewhere in the LaserCAD package 
itself. 

For the best support from your python IDE I can recommend to copy the LaserCAD 
folder in your standard python search path, so for example side by side with 
the numpy package.
