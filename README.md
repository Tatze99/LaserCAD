# LaserCAD
Procrastination next level



# How to use:
Install FreeCAD
Download the repository with git clone
If you use the download zip, rename the folder to LaserCAD
(and not LaserCAD-main or something)

In the tutorial folder you can find examples like "4_LensesAndMirrors.py"

You can run the script in any python environment, it will give you a text
output.
If you run the script in FreeCAD (like a macro) it will generate 3D output.
